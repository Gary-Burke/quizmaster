## Introduction

Quizmaster is a fun and inter-active general knowledge game to be played by individuals.
The main goal of the app, is to test a player's knowledge in a certain field or category and at the same time, expand their knowledge in that specific field.
Since this is a Command Line interface, I opted for an app where graphics and visual ques are not needed. Playing and learning at the same time makes quiz games fun and exciting, that is why I chose to develop Quizmaster.

## UX

### User Stories

| Target | Expectation | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| As a player | it would be good to see a clear and concise landing page | so that I know what the game is about. |
| As a player | I want to see the rules clearly seperated from the welcome message | and kept short and direct. |
| As a player | it would be exciting if I could choose different categories | with which to play the quiz game. |
| As a player | it would be good to know how many questions there are in the selected quiz | so as to know the length of the game. |
| As a player | my input needs to be validated and a clear error message needs to be displayed when my input is invalid |  so as to ensure a proper and smooth gaming experience. |
| As a player |  I want to get feedback on my answers, whether they are right or wrong | and if wrong, I want to know what the actual correct answer is. |
| As a player |  I would like to be able to submit my name in the game | to get a personalized feedback when the game is over. |
| As a player |  it would be a good experience to see how many answers I got correct | so that I can challenge myself again next time. |
| As a player |   I would like to be able to answer a question with a number or with text, e.g. "2" or "Two" | this would add to the user experience. |


### Wireframes

To follow best practice, a flowchart was created to showcase the progression of the Python app.
I've used [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/examples/flowchart-maker) to design my app flowchart.

![screenshot](documentation/readme/flowchart.png)

### Structure

**User Flow**
1. User opens the app ‚Üí Sees the rules and categories listed.
2. User selects a category ‚Üí Inputs number to chooses category.
3. Program gets the corresponding worksheet from Google Sheets for the quiz.
3. Program asks user for his name ‚Üí User inputs name into the input field
4. User sees start game message ‚Üí The user name, selected category and total number of questions are displayed
5. User sees first question ‚Üí User supplies answer
6. User gets feedback ‚Üí Asnwer was correct or incorrect
7. User gets feedback ‚Üí If answer was incorrect, then correct answer is displayed
8. User sees next question ‚Üí Game repeats until all questions have been cycled through
9. App informs user that the game is over and how many answers he got correct.


### Features

### Existing Features

| Feature | Notes | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Category Selection | The user can choose which category he wants to be quizzed on. This makes the game more versatile and fun. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/01-category.png) |
| Add Name | The user gets to add his name for the game. This is used to provide a customized message to the user, making him feel welcomed. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/02-name.png) |
| Welcome Message | The program greets the user by name, confirms the selected category and displays the amount of questions. This gives the user all the information needed as the game is about to start. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/03-welcome.png) |
| Questions Feedback | The program informs the player when an answer is correct or incorrect and if incorrect, provides the actual answer. Although the input is spelling sensitive, it is not case sensitive. This provides a better player experience. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/04-quiz-feedback.png) |
|  | The program makes provision for answers to be written in both words or numbers, when applicable, e.g. "Two" or "2". In some cases typos and spelling mistakes are accounted for but this is not extensive. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/05-answers.png) |
| Game Over Message | The program informs the player when the quiz has been completed with a customized message, which also provides feedback on how many questions the player got correct. This adds a competitive edge to the game. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/06-game-over.png) |

> [!NOTE]  
> For all data validation features, please refer to the defensive testing in the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

### Future Features

- **Spelling and typos**: As this game relies on user input, it would be beneficial to add an extensie list of rules or exceptions, to catch spelling mistakes, typos or alternative spellings from the user and account for them.
- **Add more categories**: I would like to expand the game by adding several more categories of question to choose from.
- **High Score API**: It would add value to the game to be able to store and track the high scores for each player and their various categories.

## Database Design

### Data Model

#### Flowchart

To follow best practice, a flowchart was created for the app's logic, and mapped out using a free version of [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ER-diagram-symbols-and-meaning) and/or [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io). The flowchart below represents the main process of this Python program. It shows the entire cycle of the application.

![screenshot](documentation/flowchart.png)

‚ö†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED ‚ö†Ô∏è

Looking for an interactive version of your flowchart? Consider using a [`Mermaid flowchart`](https://mermaid.live). To simplify the process, you can ask ChatGPT (or similar) the following prompt:

> ChatGPT Prompt:  
> "Generate a Markdown syntax Mermaid flowchart using a screenshot of my existing flowchart"  
> [paste-your-flowchart-screenshot-into-ChatGPT]

The "Love Sandwiches" sample flowchart in Markdown syntax using Mermaid can be seen below as an example.

**NOTE**: A Markdown Preview tool doesn't show the interactive flowchart, you must first commit/push the code to your GitHub repository in order to see it live in action.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Get Sales Data]
    B --> C{Is Data Valid?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Convert Data to Integers]
    C -->|No| B
    D --> E[Update Sales Worksheet]
    E --> F[Calculate Surplus Data]
    F --> G[Update Surplus Worksheet]
    G --> H[Get Last 5 Sales Entries]
    H --> I[Calculate Stock Data]
    I --> J[Update Stock Worksheet]
    J --> K[End]
```

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END --- ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Classes & Functions

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Use this space to explain your Python classes (if applicable) and functions. Examples below for inspiration, although Love Sandwiches doesn't use this example `Person` class/object.

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END --- ‚ö†Ô∏è

The program uses classes as a blueprint for the project's object-oriented programming (OOP). This allows for the object to be reusable and callable where necessary.

```python
class Person:
    """ Insert docstring comments here """
    def __init__(self, name, age, health, inventory):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.health = health
        self.inventory = inventory
```

The primary functions used on this application are:

- `get_sales_data()`
    - Get sales figures input from the user.
- `validate_data()`
    - Converts all string values into integers.
- `update_worksheet()`
    - Update the relevant worksheet with the data provided.
- `calculate_surplus_data()`
    - Compare sales with stock and calculate the surplus for each item type.
- `get_last_5_entries_sales()`
    - Collects columns of data from sales worksheet.
- `calculate_stock_data()`
    -  Calculate the average stock for each item type, adding 10%.
- `main()`
    - Run all program functions.

#### Imports

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Use this space to explain your Python imports and packages, with some common examples found below.

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END --- ‚ö†Ô∏è

I've used the following Python packages and external imports.

- `gspread`: used with the Google Sheets API
- `google.oauth2.service_account`: used for the Google Sheets API credentials
- `time`: used for adding time delays
- `os`: used for adding a `clear()` function
- `colorama`: used for including color in the terminal
- `random`: used to get a random choice from a list

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

‚ö†Ô∏è TIP ‚ö†Ô∏è

Consider adding screenshots of your Projects Board(s), Issues (open and closed), and Milestone tasks.

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END ---‚ö†Ô∏è

[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/Gary-Burke/quizmaster/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project. Through it, EPICs, User Stories, issues/bugs, and Milestone tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the Kanban project board.

![screenshot](documentation/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/Gary-Burke/quizmaster/issues) served as an another Agile tool. There, I managed my User Stories and Milestone tasks, and tracked any issues/bugs.

| Link | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-search/Gary-Burke/quizmaster?query=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20-label%3Abug&label=Open%20Issues&color=yellow)](https://www.github.com/Gary-Burke/quizmaster/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20-label%3Abug) | ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-open.png) |
| [![GitHub closed issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-search/Gary-Burke/quizmaster?query=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20-label%3Abug&label=Closed%20Issues&color=green)](https://www.github.com/Gary-Burke/quizmaster/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20-label%3Abug) | ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-closed.png) |

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into User Stories for prioritizing and implementing them. Using this approach, I was able to apply "MoSCoW" prioritization and labels to my User Stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered - required to Pass the project (*max ~60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration - future features

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

Code Institute has provided a [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) to display the terminal view of this backend application in a modern web browser. This is to improve the accessibility of the project to others.

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://quizmaster-game-dfe6a1b8c370.herokuapp.com).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), then finally, click **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set the value of **KEY** to `PORT`, and the **VALUE** to `8000` then select **ADD**.
- If using any confidential credentials, such as **CREDS.JSON**, then these should be pasted in the Config Variables as well.
- Further down, to support dependencies, select **Add Buildpack**.
- The order of the buildpacks is important; select `Python` first, then `Node.js` second. (if they are not in this order, you can drag them to rearrange them)

Heroku needs some additional files in order to deploy properly.

- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
- [Procfile](Procfile)
- [.python-version](.python-version)

You can install this project's **[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)** (*where applicable*) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **[Procfile](Procfile)** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`

The **[.python-version](.python-version)** file tells Heroku the specific version of Python to use when running your application.

- `3.12` (or similar)

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either (*recommended*):

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (*replace `app_name` with your app name*)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The Python terminal window should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Google Sheets API

This application uses [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets) to handle a "makeshift" database on the live site.

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

The sample Sheet below follows along with the CI Love Sandwiches lessons, so make sure to refactor to your own project requirements.

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END ---‚ö†Ô∏è

To run your own version of this application, you will need to create your own Google Sheet with three sheets named `sales`, `surplus`, and `stock` in the following format:

| cheese ham | tom moz | chicken salad | egg salad | hummus veg | ham egg |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sample data | sample data | sample data | sample data | sample data | sample data |
| sample data | sample data | sample data | sample data | sample data | sample data |
| sample data | sample data | sample data | sample data | sample data | sample data |

A credentials file in `.JSON` format from the Google Cloud Platform is also mandatory:

[Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com)

1. From the dashboard click on "Select a project", and then the **NEW PROJECT** button.
2. Give the project a name, and then click **CREATE**.
3. Click **SELECT PROJECT** to get to the project page.
4. From the side-menu, select "APIs & Services", then select "Library".
5. Search for the "Google Drive API", select it, and then click on **ENABLE**.
6. Click on the **CREATE CREDENTIALS** button.
7. From the "Which API are you using?" dropdown menu, choose **Google Drive API**.
8. For the "What data will you be accessing?" question, select **Application Data**.
9. Click **Next**.
10. Enter a "Service Account" name, then click **Create**.
11. In the "Role" dropdown box, choose "Basic" > "Editor", then press **Continue**.
12. "Grant users access to this service account" can be left blank. Click **DONE**.
13. On the next page, click on the "Service Account" that has been created.
14. On the next page, click on the "Keys" tab.
15. Click on the "Add Key" dropdown, and select "Create New Key".
16. Select `JSON`, and then click **Create**. This will trigger the `.json` file with your API credentials in it to download to your machine locally.
17. For local deployment, this needs to be renamed to `creds.json`.
18. Repeat steps 4 & 5 above to add the "Google Sheets API".
19. Copy the `client_email` that is in the `creds.json` file.
20. Share your Google Sheet to the `client_email`, ensuring "Editing" is enabled.
21. Add the `creds.json` file to your `.gitignore` file, so as not to push your credentials to GitHub publicly.


### Local Development

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

If using any confidential credentials, such as `CREDS.json` or `env.py` data, these will need to be manually added to your own newly created project as well.

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/Gary-Burke/quizmaster).
2. Locate and click on the green "Code" button at the very top, above the commits and files.
3. Select whether you prefer to clone using "HTTPS", "SSH", or "GitHub CLI", and click the "copy" button to copy the URL to your clipboard.
4. Open "Git Bash" or "Terminal".
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone the repository:
	- `git clone https://www.github.com/Gary-Burke/quizmaster.git`
7. Press "Enter" to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Ona (formerly Gitpod), you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Ona-Gitpod](https://ona.com/run-in-ona.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://www.github.com/Gary-Burke/quizmaster)

**Please Note**: in order to directly open the project in Ona (Gitpod), you should have the browser extension installed. A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, you make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository. You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://www.github.com/Gary-Burke/quizmaster).
2. At the top of the Repository, just below the "Settings" button on the menu, locate and click the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

### Local VS Deployment

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Use this space to discuss any differences between the local version you've developed, and the live deployment site. Generally, there shouldn't be [m]any major differences, so if you honestly cannot find any differences, feel free to use the following example:

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END --- ‚ö†Ô∏è

There are no remaining major differences between the local version when compared to the deployed version online.

## Credits

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

In the following sections, you need to reference where you got your content, media, and any extra help. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials (which is totally acceptable), however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid potential plagiarism.

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END ---‚ö†Ô∏è

### Content

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Use this space to provide attribution links for any borrowed code snippets, elements, and resources. Ideally, you should provide an actual link to every resource used, not just a generic link to the main site. If you've used multiple components from the same source (such as Bootstrap), then you only need to list it once, but if it's multiple Codepen samples, then you should list each example individually. If you've used AI for some assistance (such as ChatGPT or Perplexity), be sure to mention that as well. A few examples have been provided below to give you some ideas.

Eventually you'll want to learn how to use Git branches. Here's a helpful tutorial called [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org) to bookmark for later.
